    "A network (graph) describes a collection of nodes (vertices) and the links (edges) between them. A node can represent anything from individuals or firms or countries, or even collections of such entities. A link between two nodes signifies a direct relation between them. For example, in a social context, a link could be a friendship tie, while in the context of countries, a link may be a free trade agreement or a mutual defense pact. In a directed network where there is a clear distinction between source (the sender of a tie) and target (the receiver of the tie), relationships between two nodes are recorded as either asymmetric, mutual,  or null. Asymmetric is when a nomination is unidirectional (i.e. when only one person claims to know/be friends/to have spoken with the other person); a mutual (reciprocal) relation is when both nominate each other; and a null relation is when there is no connection or link that exists. \n"
