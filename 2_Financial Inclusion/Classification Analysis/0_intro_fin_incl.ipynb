    "<h1 align=center> Financial Inclusion Classification using SVM & Decision Trees (Draft) </h1>\n",

    "### OVERVIEW\n",
    "\n",
    "Financial inclusion means that individuals and businesses have access to useful and affordable financial products and services that meet their needs – transactions, payments, savings, credit and insurance – delivered in a responsible and sustainable way. It also facilitates day-to-day living, and helps families and businesses plan for everything from long-term goals to unexpected emergencies (WB).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is an estimated 2 billion individuals who remain unbanked or underbanked , majority of which are Africans. Much of this hare is concentrated in rural and isolate areas. The past 10 years have seen a rapid growth in the mobile money market as financial institutions continue to invest, opening up new channels of development in mobile money applications that deiver financial services services through mobile phone networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Digital financial services — including those involving the use of mobile phones — have now been launched in more than 80 countries, with some reaching significant scale. As a result, millions of formerly excluded and underserved poor customers are moving from exclusively cash-based transactions to formal financial services using a mobile phone or other digital technology to access these services(WB).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are currently 2.6 billion smartphone subscriptions globally — a number that’s expected to hit 6.1 billion by 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of mobile phones (USSD) as a conduit to access financial services has become a standard preference of payment compared to formal insitustions. As of 2021 more than half (54%) of africans pay using mobile money  reasons for success are typically in areas where formal banking institutions are inaccessible, therefore negative correlation. Variables such as branch access, transation costs and fees, and quality/convenience/time to transaction (instant transfers) are reported as critical factors to a persons decision to adopt. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additional factors are: \n",
    "-Access to agent networks and phone networks. \n",
    "-Agent points (supermarket/petrol station, anywhere to withdraw or deposit) similar to atm. person with a mobile phone that takes and gives at the point of withdrawal and point of deposit. [Cost of agent is less than setting up atm. Does not need internet connection.] \n",
    "\n",
    "### PROBLEM STATEMENT\n",
    "While the adoption of mobile money services has garnered rapid growth in Africa, many remain financially excluded. To accelerate the reach of these services and allow for higher rates of adoption, we need to understand what drivers are critical for adoption and sustainable usage. The findings from this analysis can help increase penetration in unbanked/underbanked markets across Tanzania and rest of Africa (i.e. increase financial inclusion by decreasing the number of unbanked).\n",
    "\n",
    "So thinking about this problem, we might also be interested in exploring the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What the current take-up for financial products is across different dimensions, i.e location, age, gender etc:\n",
    "2. What variables appear the most correlated with the take-up?\n",
    "3. What is the most common/important use for financial products?\n",
    "4. There is adoption most prevelant (region)?\n",
    "4. The average distance between a financial access points?\n",
    "5. The number of financial access points within a specified radius?\n",
    "\n",
    "### OBJECTIVE\n",
    "\n",
    "Using data on mobile money use of individuals in Tanzania, as well as spatial data on financial access points, we try to predict mobile money use by classifying each individual into four mutually exclusive categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "0. No_financial_services: Individuals who do not use mobile money, do not save, do not have credit, and do not have insurance\n",
    "1. Other_only: Individuals who do not use mobile money, but do use at least one of the other financial services (savings, credit, insurance)\n",
    "2. Mm_only: Individuals who use mobile money only\n",
    "3. Mm_plus: Individuals who use mobile money and also use at least one of the other financial services (savings, credit/borrowing, insurance)\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we could treat this as an optimisation problem where we would like to find out which areas to expand our markets given the current degree of inclusion and accessibility to financial services in Tanzania.   \n",
    "\n",
    "### METHOD\n",
    "In this analysis, we explore how machine learning can be used to classify individuals into one of four categories based on the types of financial services they are most likely to use. This is an example of multi-class classification where the task involves using an algorithm to induce a mapping function between a given set of input features and a categorical target variable that takes on more than two values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### DATA SOURCES\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Financial Access Data\n",
    "\n",
    ">The Financial Access Data is the geospatial mapping of all cash outlets in Tanzania in 2012. Cash outlets in this case included commercial banks, community banks, ATMs, microfinance institutions, mobile money agents, bus stations and post offices. This data was collected by FSDT.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Financial Inclusion Data\n",
    "\n",
    ">The Financial Inclusion Data contains demographic information and what financial services are used by approximately 10,000 individuals across Tanzania. This data was extracted from the FSDT Finscope 2017 survey and prepared specifically for this challenge. More about the Finscope survey\n",
    "\n",
    "3. National Statistics Data \n",
    "\n",
    ">The Population Data uses 2012 census data extracted from the \"Administrative units Population Distribution Report\" pulished on the Tanzania Bureau of Statistics website: https://www.nbs.go.tz/nbs/takwimu/Census2022/Administrative_units_Population_Distribution_Report_Tanzania_volume1a.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    ">The GDP Data uses 2017 gdp per capita data extracted from the \"National Accounts of Tanzania Mainland 2017\" published on the Tanzania Bureau of Statistics website: https://www.nbs.go.tz/index.php/en/census-surveys/national-accounts-statistics/na-statistics-by-subject\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes: Although we don't have any information that directly measures social economic status, such as income, wealth, etc, the features in our dataset can be used as a proxy for wealth. For example, we can assume that those who have attained a higher level degree, own land, and are employed are generally more \n",
