    "<h1 align=center> Financial Inclusion Classification using SVM & Decision Trees (Working Doc) </h1>\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### OVERVIEW\n",
    "\n",
    "Financial inclusion means that individuals and businesses have access to useful and affordable financial products and services that meet their needs – transactions, payments, savings, credit and insurance – delivered in a responsible and sustainable way. It also facilitates day-to-day living, and helps families and businesses plan for everything from long-term goals to unexpected emergencies (WB).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is an estimated 2 billion individuals who remain unbanked or underbanked , majority of which are Africans. Much of this hare is concentrated in rural and isolate areas. The past 10 years have seen a rapid growth in the mobile money market as financial institutions continue to invest, opening up new channels of development in mobile money applications that deiver financial services services through mobile phone networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Digital financial services — including those involving the use of mobile phones — have now been launched in more than 80 countries, with some reaching significant scale. As a result, millions of formerly excluded and underserved poor customers are moving from exclusively cash-based transactions to formal financial services using a mobile phone or other digital technology to access these services(WB).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are currently 2.6 billion smartphone subscriptions globally — a number that’s expected to hit 6.1 billion by 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use phone (USSD) as a conduit to access financial services become a standard preference of payment compared to formal insitustions. As of 2021 more than half (54%) of africans pay using mobile money  reasons for success are typically in areas where formal banking institutions are inaccessible, therefore negative correlation. Variables such as branch access, transation costs and fees, and quality/convenience/time to transaction (instant transfers) are reported as critical factors to a persons decision to adopt. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additional factors are: \n",
    "-Access to agent networks and phone networks. \n",
    "-Agent points (supermarket/petrol station, anywhere to withdraw or deposit) similar to atm. person with a mobile phone that takes and gives at the point of withdrawal and point of deposit. [Cost of agent is less than setting up atm. Does not need internet connection.] \n",
    "\n",
    "### PROBLEM STATEMENT\n",
    "While the adoption of mobile money services has garnered rapid growth in Africa, many remain financially excluded. To accelerate the reach of these services and allow for higher rates of adoption, we need to understand what drivers are critical for adoption and sustainable usage (i.e. increase financial inclusion by decreasing the number of unbanked)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### OBJECTIVE\n",
    "Predict mobile money adoption for individuals in Tanzania, given demographic and spatial information. This can help increase penetration in unbanked/underbanked markets across Tanzania and rest of Africa. us optimize A/C and heater loads, minimizing building energy consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using data on... explore the following questions:\n",
    "Your goal is to accurately classify each individual into four mutually exclusive categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions to explore\n",
    "So thinking about this question, we might be interested in knowing:\n",
    "\n",
    "- who uses mobile money (demographics/social economic status)\n",
    "- where is adoption most prevelant (region)?\n",
    "- does access to financial institutions affect mobile money adoption?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What the current take-up for financial products  is across different dimensions, i.e location, age, gender etc.\n",
    "2. What variables appear the most correlated with the take-up.\n",
    "3. What is the most common/important use for financial products?\n",
    "4. The average distance between a financial access point\n",
    "5. The number of financial access points per area?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we don't have any information that directly measures social economic status, such as income, wealth, etc, the features in our dataset can be used as a proxy for wealth. For example, we can assume that someone who has attained a higher level degree, owns land, and is employed \n",
    "\n",
    "### METHOD\n",
    "In this analysis, we explore how machine learning can be used to classify individuals into one of four categories based on the types of financial services they are most likely to use. This is an example of multi-class classification where the task involves using an algorithm to induce a mapping function between a given set of input features and a categorical target variable that takes on more than two values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### DATA SOURCES\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Financial Access Data\n",
    "\n",
    ">The Financial Access Data is the geospatial mapping of all cash outlets in Tanzania in 2012. Cash outlets in this case included commercial banks, community banks, ATMs, microfinance institutions, mobile money agents, bus stations and post offices. This data was collected by FSDT.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Financial Inclusion Data\n",
    "\n",
    ">The Financial Inclusion Data contains demographic information and what financial services are used by approximately 10,000 individuals across Tanzania. This data was extracted from the FSDT Finscope 2017 survey and prepared specifically for this challenge. More about the Finscope survey\n",
    "\n",
    "3. National Statistics Data \n",
    "\n",
    ">The Population Data uses 2012 census data extracted from the \"Administrative units Population Distribution Report\" pulished on the Tanzania Bureau of Statistics website: https://www.nbs.go.tz/nbs/takwimu/Census2022/Administrative_units_Population_Distribution_Report_Tanzania_volume1a.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    ">The GDP Data uses 2017 gdp per capita data extracted from the \"National Accounts of Tanzania Mainland 2017\" published on the Tanzania Bureau of Statistics website: https://www.nbs.go.tz/index.php/en/census-surveys/national-accounts-statistics/na-statistics-by-subject\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### MEASUREMENT\n",
    "\n",
    "Our contributions are threefold: (1) we analyze\n",
    "the customers’ usage of M-Pesa and report large-scale paerns of behavior; (2) we present the results of applying machine\n",
    "learning models to predict mobile money adoption (AUC=0.691), and mobile money spending (AUC=0.619) using multiple\n",
    "data sources: mobile phone data, M-Pesa agent information, the number of M-Pesa friends in the user’s social network, and\n",
    "the characterization of the user’s geographic location; (3) we discuss the most predictive features in both models and draw\n",
    "key implications for the design of mobile money services in a developing country. \n",
    "\n",
    "0. No_financial_services: Individuals who do not use mobile money, do not save, do not have credit, and do not have insurance\n",
    "1. Other_only: Individuals who do not use mobile money, but do use at least one of the other financial services (savings, credit, insurance)\n",
    "2. Mm_only: Individuals who use mobile money only\n",
    "3. Mm_plus: Individuals who use mobile money and also use at least one of the other financial services (savings, credit/borrowing, insurance)\n",
