    "Networks form the building blocks of any group of people, organisations, entities; basically anything that can be defined as having a relation. Often the objective of social network analysis is to obtain a better understanding of the behaviour and influence of the systems they represent and the systems they interact with. Ultimately, it is about finding the link between network structure and network function and vice versa. For instance, we can study social networks to better understand the nature of social interactions and their implications for human experience, commerce, the spread of disease, and the structure of society. In many social science studies, the value of social networks is expressed in how the degree to which a group of people are socially connected with each other reinforces beliefs that are commonly held, and how this could help transmit novel information that could change the dynamics of the interaction and potentially alter outcomes. Therefore, programmes that rely on the relationships, interactions, and cooperation of people to succeed can take advantage of the network structure of targeted communities. In other words, knowing which people, positions, and groups to target in a community can be critical to achieve higher rates of efficiency in interventions.  \n",

    "Notable studies on the role of social networks include:\n",
    "- labour market participation in referral networks and migrant communities;\n",
    "- drug use and school attendance in student networks;\n",
    "- policy views of electoral candidates and coalitions in discourse networks;\n",
    "- advocacy of climate change in social media networks;\n",
    "- spread of infectious diseases and financial crises in contagion networks;\n",
    "- adoption and support of new technologies in global networks and local farming networks.\n",

    "#### Definition\n",
    "A network (graph) describes a collection of nodes (vertices) and the links (edges) between them. A node can represent anything from individuals or firms or countries, or even collections of such entities. A link between two nodes signifies a direct relation between them like a link between two friends. Some terminology:\n",
    "- A *directed network* is where there is a clear distinction between source (the sender of a tie) and target (the receiver of the tie), relationships between two nodes are recorded as either asymmetric, mutual,  or null. Asymmetric is when a nomination is unidirectional (i.e. when only one person claims to know/be friends/to have spoken with the other person); a mutual (reciprocal) relation is when both nominate each other; and a null relation is when there is no connection or link that exists. \n",
    "- An *undirected network* makes no distinction between sender (the person who contacted someone else for support or advice) and target (the person who had been contacted for support or advice). Simply, once someone says they know someone, we assume the reverse, that the other person knows them.\n",
    "- A *connected component* is a complete network or sub-network where every node is atleast connected to one other node, i.e. there must exist a path such that any two nodes can be connected starting from point *A* to point *Z*. If there exists a node *K* in the network where it is not possible to connect a path between any other node in the network, then we say the network is disconnected. \n",
    "- A *giant component* is the subnetwork found by extracting the component with the largest number of connected nodes in the network."

    "#### Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "When exploring the question of how social networks affect the spread of ideas, norms, and behaviour, the first key aspect to consider is a network's structure or topology. Who a person is connected to is who they come into contact with, and therefore who they \"allow\" to have an impact on their behaviour. The extent to which this affects the individual is predicated on how they \"choose\" to come into contact with this person: how close they are, how frequent the contact is, is it through a close knit group of mutual friends or through separate interactions? Given the many factors that determine the diffusion process, a common approach is to examine the network for \"small world\" features. Small worlds characterise a fascinating aspect of large social networks that find that even if nodes in a network are not directly connected, the likelihood that their neighbours are each others neighbours is high. This means any given node in a network can be reached in a small number of steps, which translates to a short average path length and a high clustering coefficient. Naturally, this creates an easy path for diffusion of information, where higher levels of cooperation and  efficiency are more likely. \n",

    "Network centrality is a measure of a node's ties relative to the ties present in the network and the distribution of ties throughout the network.

    "One way to determine the extent to which ties strengthen collective interest is by assessing the network's interaction structure. Many studies attempt to evaluate the performance of different network structures based on their ability to converge to a cooperative outcome.
